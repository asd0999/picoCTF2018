#go to link and open elements in dev tools (cmd+option+i)
#construct the flag and log in with it

#optional - write a script
#the script you see in the get_flag.sh works on mac osx
#easier way to do this is as follows:

curl -s "http://2018shell.picoctf.com:8249/" | head -n 20 | cut -d "'" -f2 | tail -n 8 | tac | tr -d "\n"

#but this wont run on osx because tac is a linux command
