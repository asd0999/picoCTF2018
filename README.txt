#all challenges have been names with an _ instead of space

#in some challenges i have made scripts to retrieve the flag
#bash scripts end with .sh and python scripts end with .py extension

#scipts with .py extension are for python2.7 except where mentioned specifically that it is for python3
#my system default is python3 so i use python2.7 get_flag.py to run python2.7 scripts

#to run bash scripts simply run ./get_flag.sh

#however, before you run the scripts, you need to make the files executable
#you do this by chmod +x get_flag.sh or chmod +x get_flag.py
