#go to link

#you need to set your user agent to googles user agent to retrieve flag
#google "google user agent"
#google's user agent is used:

Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0.1; Nexus 5X Build/MMB29P) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.96 Mobile Safari/537.36 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)

#then you can use curl to HTTP request the page again with google's user agent 
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0.1; Nexus 5X Build/MMB29P) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.96 Mobile Safari/537.36 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)" "http://2018shell.picoctf.com:60372/flag"

#A for userAgent

#alternatively, use a script to retrieve flag
#ive made both bash and python3 scripts for this challenge
